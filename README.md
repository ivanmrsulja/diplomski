## Hand tracking and gesture recognition using neural networks and traditional model pipeline
This paper presents a solution for hand tracking and gesture recognition using a pipeline consisting of the Mediapipe Hands model
and a classification model (neural network, SVM, and random forest). The system was tested on the German Sign Language dataset.
